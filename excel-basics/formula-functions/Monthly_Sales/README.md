### Solution

**Steps:**
- Use the formula ````=C4*D4```` to calculate the daily revenue. Use auto-fill to complete the data in the ````Total```` column.

- Use ````=SUM(C4:C33)```` on ````C35```` to calculate the monthly revenue by summing up the daily revenue from ````Total```` column.

- Use ````=SUM(C4:C33)```` on ````C36```` to calculate total unit sold in month by summing up the daily sales entry from ````Number of Units Sold````.

- Use ````=MIN(C4:C33)```` and ````=MAX(C4:C33)```` to find the minimum and maximum sales in the month.

- Use ````=COUNTA(B4:B33)```` to calculate the number of entries in the ````Days```` column. It is important to use ````COUNTA```` instead of ````COUNT```` because ````COUNT```` only takes into account numeric entries, hence none of the date entries will be recorded and ````Days In Month```` will be 0.

- Use ````=AVERAGE(E4:E33)```` to calculate the average value from te ````Total```` column to obtain the daily revenue in the month.
