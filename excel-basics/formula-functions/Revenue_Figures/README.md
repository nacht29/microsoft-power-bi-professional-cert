### Task Summary
Aimee at Adventure Works has asked you to help her prepare an Excel file that she will present at a management team financial review meeting. The worksheet tracks the items sold by one of Adventure Workâ€™s divisions. The file needs to contain results such as costs, revenue, and profit. Your task is to create the formulas and calculations for this sheet.

### Solution

**Steps:**

- Use the formula ````=E4*F4```` in cell ````G4```` to calculate the ````Purchase Cost````. Use auto-fill to complete calculation in column G.

- Use the formula ````=F4*$P$1```` to calculate the ````Shipping Cost```` for ````F4````. Use auto-fill to complete calculation for column F. Note that absolute cell reference ````$P$1```` to ````P1```` to ensure ````Shipping rate (per item)```` stays constant when using auto-fill.

- Use the formula ````=G4+H4```` on ````I4````. This sums the total ````Purchase Cost```` and total ````Shipping Cost```` to calculate the ````Total Costs```` of purchasing all of each entry's item. Use auto-fill to complete the data in column I.

- Use the formula ````=(I4/F4)*1.5```` on ````J4```` to calculate the retail price for each item. In the case study it is stated the retail price must ensure a profit of 50% from the total cost for each item.

- In continuation to the point above: use ````(I4/F4)```` to divide the ````Total Costs```` by ````Items Purchased```` to obtain the cost of one item. Then, multiply the value by 1.5 to calculate the retail price to include the extra 50% markup.

- Use the formula ````=J4*K4```` on ````L4```` to calculate the ````Total Revenue```` for each entry by multiplying the retail price per unit and items sold. Complete the data in column L with autofill.

- Use the formula ````=L80-I80```` on ````M4```` to calculate the ````Profit```` for each entry by subtracting the ````Total Costs```` from ````Revenue```` for each entry. Complete the data in column M with autofill.

- Use the formula ````=SUM(G4:G200)```` on ````G201```` to sum up the ````Purchase Cost```` of all entries. Use autofill on ````G201:M201```` to sum up the ````Shipping Costs````, ````Total Costs````, ````Retail Price (per unit)````, ````Items Sold````, ````Revenue```` and ````Profit```` for all entries.

- To calculate ````Profit```` as in total profit for ````O2````, simply use ````=M201```` in ````P3```` to refer to the cell that contains the value for the sum of profits.

- To calculate ````Profit Margin```` for ````O3````, use ````=M201/L201```` on ````P3````, then format the cell data type to percentage. This gives the profit as a percentage of the total cost:

	````profit margin = profit/total cost * 100%````.
