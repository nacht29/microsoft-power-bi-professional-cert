### Solution

**Steps:**

1. Formatting data
    - For readability, format the date to ```dd/mm/yyyy```.

    - Select ```C5:D5```, go to ```Home > Number```. Select the drop down box (it should likely show "General")  Select ```More Number Formats > Date```. In the ```Type``` option, select the format with ```dd/mm/yyyy```. Example: ```*14/3/2012```.

    - The original data is from the year 2023. For this project's purpose, we update the year to 2025 and onwards. 

    - Use ```=DATE(YEAR(C5)+2,MONTH(C5),DAY(C5))``` and ```DATE(YEAR(D5)+2,MONTH(D5),DAY(D5))``` on ```E5``` and ```F5``` respectively to increment the original date data by 2. Select ```E5:F5``` and use auto-fill to complete the data for columns E and F.

    - Select the data in columns E and F. Use ```Ctrl + C``` to copy the values in both columns. Use auto-fill to select the cells containing data in columns C and D then use ```Ctrl + Alt + V``` to paste the values copied without copying over the formula. Delete the data in columns E and F.

2. Creating the report
    - Use ```=TODAY()``` in ```B1``` to obtain the current date according to the computer's calendar.

    - In ```E5```, use ```=D5-$B$1``` to calculate the number of days between the current date to the project's launch date. Note the absolute cell reference ```$B$1``` as we want to ensure the current date is constant for the calculation in the cells in ```Calendar Days to launch``` column.

    - Use ```S=NETWORKDAY($B$1,D5,$J$5:$J$26)``` on ```F5``` to calculate the number of working days from the current date to the launch date. the ```NETWORKDAY``` function excludes holidays listed in ```J5:J26``` and also weekends. Note the absolute cell reference ```$J$5:$J$26``` to keep the holiday dates constant in the calculations.
