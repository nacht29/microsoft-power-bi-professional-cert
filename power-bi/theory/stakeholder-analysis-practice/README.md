# Case Study - Stakeholder Analysis

### Company
Adventure Works is in the sports goods business. It is a large, multinational manufacturing company that produces and distributes bicycles and accessories to global markets. The company has established itself as a trusted brand. However, with the entry of new competitors, their market share has been threatened. 

### Scenario 
The company has decided to take a new approach to maintain its position in the market. As a result, Renee, the marketing director at Adventure Works, has asked you to conduct a sales data analysis project. Renee is responsible for creating and implementing marketing campaigns.

The goal of the project is to use the insights gained from the analysis of sales data to drive new marketing campaigns and improve the company's market share. The project aims to identify customer preferences, buying patterns, and trends, which will be used to create targeted marketing campaigns that will appeal to the company's existing customer base, and attract new customers.

To achieve this, you need to identify the key people in the business who can provide valuable insights into the company's current sales and marketing strategies. You must interview company managers with different responsibilities and roles to gain a comprehensive understanding of the company's sales and marketing operations.
